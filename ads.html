      <p>ADS, NOT GOOGLE ADS</p>
    </div>
    <p>There's an important distinction between Ads and Google Ads. It took me a few meetings to learn this difference.
      Google Ads services business, while Ads specifically services enterprise businesses. Trust me, I wasn't aware of
      this at first either. However, it's important for identifying the audience that I'm writing.
    </p>

    <p>My summer project had 3 overarching themes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>UX writing for new features</li>
      <li>Advocating for in-product education</li>
      <li>Documenting product launches</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Due to the nature of the product, the project details and internal deliverables are under NDA. For anyone at
      Google, feel free to check out my work as rhoh@.
    </p>


    <div class="header row-span">
      <span class="material-icons">fingerprint</span>
      <p>THE PROBLEM</p>
    </div>

    <p>With the current user interface, users of Campaign Manager and Display & Video 360 have to understand a large
      amount of complicated, ads-related jargon. As a result, users were filing tickets because they couldn't onboard
      as quickly as they would like.
      This is due to several reasons:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Lack of context within the product</li>
      <li>Inconsistent use of terminology or concepts across products</li>
      <li>Outdated or unclear documentation</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="header row-span">
      <span class="material-icons">fingerprint</span>
      <p>THE SOLUTION</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <p><b>UX writing for new features</b></p>
      <p>I wrote the in-UI and email content for a new feature related to bulk action in Campaign Manager 360. I
        collaborated with the teams' software engineers, interaction designers, and product technology manager to
        decide on the product direction of the feature.</p>

      <p>Deliverables included naming the feature, drafts of email
        content and in-UI text. The purpose of this was to communicate to the user the status of their bulk action in
        order to provide consistent feedback. Challenges included maintaining consistency between the UI, emails, and
        any downloaded content.</p>

      <p>I also drafted the UX writing for an onboarding flow to a new feature in Google Ads. The process included
        researching onboarding flow patterns, studying existing flows, and getting feedback from stakeholders in the
        project.</p>

      <p><b>Advocating for in-product education</b></p>
      <p>To advocate for in-product education and long-term documentation changes, I developed a qualitative review
        for <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10081327?hl=en" class="inline-a small-a">an existing
          article
          on modeled
          conversions.↗</a> This article in particular is important because it addresses
        user privacy and data. This topic is inconsistently used and referenced across
        multiple Ads
        products, negatively impacting a large number of users. I presented my findings to product stakeholders to
        publish the changes, which consolidated the information cross-product and clarified the Google's approach to
        conversion modeling.</p>

      <p>I also worked hands-on project for the reporting feature. Users could choose metrics and dimensions in order
        to generate reports and understand the effectiveness of their ads. However, many of the metric and dimension
        names were unfamiliar to users, resulting in them filing tickets. I worked on drafting 50+ descriptions for
        in-UI tooltips. As a result, users can simply hover over a metric and dimensions to quickly see the
        definition.</p>

      <p><b>Documenting product launches</b></p>
      <p>For reporting, I supported 3 larger product launches, 3P App Attribution, reporting quotas, and data
        downloads in instant reporting.</p>
      <p>I communicated regularly with software engineers, interaction designers, and product technology managers to
        gain understanding of the feature. My primary goal was to identify the key information to include without
        overwhelming the user with information.</p>

        <p>LEARNINGS</p>
      </div>
      <p>Technical writing is, at its core, education. We are teaching users about our products, beyond just how to
        use
        them. In order to accomplish this goal, I learned that more content isn't always the answer. Sometimes
        removing
        information or being intentional
        about the placement of content can make the main idea more clear. Placing clear, instructional writing within
        the user interface itself is an effective and accessible way to provide valuable context.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the time spent researching patterns and speaking to subject matter experts may not yield tangible
        deliverables, but it's one of the most crucial steps in the technical writing process. I now recognize the
        importance of this work and learned to communciate the impact of this work to stakeholders.</p>
