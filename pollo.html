      <h2>What does Pollo bring to the (classroom) table?</h2>
      <h3>The problem at hand</h3>
      <p>Nowadays, some professors face the challenge of gauging how well the
        hundreds of students in the lecture hall understand the material.
        On the other end of the lecture hall, students try their best to summarize
        the content in their notebooks or on their computer.
      </p>
      <h3>Polling made easy</h3>
      <p>Pollo lets professors ask questions and take live polls through our mobile and web application.
        They can ask in-class questions and recieve real-time feedback to gauge which topics their students understand,
        and which ones they may
        need spend more time on. With Pollo:</p>
      <p><strong>Send live polls.</strong> Want to know how prepared students feel for the exam or test their
        comprehension
        of the lecture? Quickly create a live poll and send it out during class.</p>
      <p><strong>Create drafts.</strong> Plan ahead for your lecture by pre-filling the polls
        you intend on using during class.</p>
      <p><strong>Organize your groups</strong>. Your polls are labelled with the date they were sent out and
        organized into custom groups. Use this to see trends in the poll outcomes.</p>
      <p><strong>Receive live feedback.</strong> As users choose their answers, Pollo shows the results to
        poll creators using easy-to-read percentages and data visualization.</p>
      <h3>Pollo in the remote learning era</h3>
      <p>Since my university transitioned to mostly online classes for Fall 2020, I teamed up with the product
        marketing member of the Pollo team to evaluate professor's adjusted teaching styles. Through a Google Form
        sent to professors across majors and class sizes, we discovered two personas:
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <img class="img-half" src="images/pollo-curious-persona.png" alt="The curious persona for Pollo." />
        <img class="img-half" src="images/pollo-hesitant-persona.png" alt="The hesitant persona for Pollo." />
      </div>
      <h2>Making Pollo my own</h2>
      <p>I joined the Pollo team when they had the goal of launching the app by the end of the semester. It was daunting
        to
        familiarize myself with all the Figma files filled to the brim with Pollo designs. Sifting through the
        interactions, I identified 2 main issues to tackle before the upcoming launch:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Visually representing which answer is correct to the student-side user.</li>
        <li>Create an identity and marketing artifacts for Pollo's launch.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>1. How do I know which answer is correct?</h2>
      <p>In Pollo, poll creators can choose to assign an answer to be correct or not. If they do, after the share the
        results of the polls,
        poll users should be able to see which answer is correct. The existing solution did a great job of visually
        representing the correct answer
        and indicating which answer the user chose. However the solution posed two issues: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The light green and gray fills did not contrast heavily, posing <strong>an accessibility issue for
            colorblind
            users.</strong></li>
        <li>Users could not tell if there is a correct answer <strong>if no one chooses the correct answer.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="images/pollo-original.png" alt="Original correct answer solution." />
      <p>I created iterations for indicating the correct answer while actively designing for both user considerations. I
        specifically avoided solutions that required the use of red to indicate incorrect answers. When used in
        classroom settings, red can carry a negative connotation that represents failure or defeat. I did not want to
        negatively impact the learning experience, so I focused more heavily on portraying the correct answer instead.
      </p>
      <img class="img-fluid img-spacing" src="images/pollo-color.png" alt="Accesibility correct answer solution." />
      <img class="img-fluid" src="images/pollo-noanswer.png" alt="No correct answer solution." />
      <p>Ultimately, I chose the solution that uses a thicker stroke and darker green color to indicate the correct
        poll.
        It <strong>does
          not rely solely on color as a visual indicator </strong>and is not confusing when no one chooses the correct
        answer, making it is a viable solution for both audiences.</p>
      <p>The final interaction for instructors and students:</p>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="images/pollo-flow.png" alt="Correct answer work flow." />
      <h2>2. Sprucing up Pollo for its launch</h2>
      <h3>Learning Pollo's identity </h3>
      <p>Pollo exists to facilitate interactions and back-and-forths between professors and students.
        I used small stars and sun rays to convey the experience of many students in a classroom inputting
        their answers simultaneously. I used a subtle gradient for the background to convey
        the dynamic nature of how the polls react to real-time results. The transparent components,
        such as the Pollo logo, checkmarks, question marks, and percentage signs, represent the data visualizations that
        formulate as the users answer the polls.</p>
      <p>I wanted to highlight Pollo's unique features so I designed a custom poll that asks "What is Pollo?", in which
        all answers are correct.
